The solution is written in python language and is in a format of a jupiter notebook.
Running this notebook can be achived in multiple platforms, we used Visual Studio Code (free). 
The requirements for running this notebook consist of the following python(it was tested using python 3.10) libraries: pandas, numpy and tqdm. 
The code is heavily commented to help understand the code better. Additional informations and explanations are in markdown cells (especially for the last task). 
The program expects the data files (csv files) to be in a folder named (movie) and this folder should be in the same directory as the jupiter notebook.
