<p>The solutions are written in python language and is in a format of a jupiter notebook.</p>
<p>Running notebooks can be achived in multiple platforms, we used Visual Studio Code localy and also uploaded the latest notebook version (starting from assignment 2) online to Google Colab (link below). </p>
<p>The requirements for running this notebook locally consist of the following python (it was tested using python 3.10) libraries: pandas, numpy and tqdm. Also you need to install Jupyter (<a href="https://jupyter.org/install">instructions</a>)</p>
<p>The code is heavily commented to help understand the code better. Additional information and explanations are in markdown cells (especially for the last task). </p>
