    "\n",
    "Our design is heavily based on the give paper (https://homepages.tuni.fi/konstantinos.stefanidis/docs/wise20.pdf), where there is a solution for methods to produce explanations for why not questions for single users. These methods are turned into explanations for group recommendations for **granularity** and **position absenteeism**. We only provide explanations for independent why not questions, constrast to the paper where there is solution for dependent questions, as in this assigment we only have to answer independent cases (Why not Matrix?, Why not action movies?, Why not rank Matrix first?)\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the paper, we distinguish between **general explanations**, which can appear in any recommender system, and **model-specific explanations** that are based on the inherent parameters of the CF group recommendation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General explanations:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The most common question is about an item that is not in the database, then evidently we provide the explanation that *the item is not suggested to the group because it is unkown for the system*. And the same in the group case when the question is a category, so a list of movies and no movie from this list was rated, we provide: *This list of movies (category) is unknown to the system*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The item is in the system but it is not rated by any user, thus our explanation will be: *it is not recommended to the group because nobody from the database rated this item*. Same in the group case when no movie from the list was rated: *This category (list of movies) was not rated by any user in the database*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarly, when no user from the group rated the movie in question, or movies in question we provide: *No user from the group rated this movie/category* thus it is not recommended, because we designed the system that we only recommend a movie if it is rated by at least 1 of the users in the group (this explanation is on the verge to be considered model specific explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Another explanation emerges from the number of returned top-k items, the reason why we don't recommend a movie for the group could be because k is low, so we check if the item is in the extended recommendations, top 2k items, but if it's lower down then we don't consider this as the problem. So if it's in the top 2k item we explain: *You asked for few items, item i is in the n-th position*\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of these are the problems then we provide a model specific explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model specific explanations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind CF group recommendations is that the system suggests items to a group based on what the group members have liked in the past. This makes all the possible explanations revolving around the ratings of the group members and the strategy that we used to aggregate these ratings. We provide explanations for the average and least misery strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "An answer for a \"Why not item A\" question thus can be concluded by analyzing the groupmembers' rating considering the strategy, so it can be concluded by the list of tuples of (user_id, score) and the given strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If no groupmember gave a high score for the item we can give the explanation: *No one from the group liked the movie*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the strategy is average then the reason why we did not recommend is because the average rating is not high enough, thus there are group members who did not like the item very much, so we provide the explanation: *n user from the group liked the movie, but m user disliked it* and provide the average rating. Similarly when the question is about a category (list of movies) then we aggregate the scores for each movie by user and provide the explanation that *n user from the group liked these movies (category) but m user disliked it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the strategy is least misery the reason can be simple for both atomic and group case: A person from the group did not like this movie/category. Thus we can tell: *user i did not like this movie/category, he/she gave score x*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the paper, when a user questions the item’s ranking in the recommendation list, the system checks the same information. The system answers questions like: “Why was not item A ranked higher?” by explaining the item’s statistics: how many groupmember liked and how many disliked the movie. This type of question is vague, in the sense that the user questions the general ranking of an item without comparing it to another item; the user issued an independent question. So the system treats it as if it was a total absenteeism question. And as the we don't answer dependent questions because it was not part of the assignment, the system will give the same answer to at as a total absenteeism question.\n"
